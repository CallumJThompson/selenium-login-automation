# Automated Login Tester (Python + Selenium)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a data-driven test automation script. It launches a browser, interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model) to input credentials, and asserts that the login was successful based on UI feedback.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.14
* **Library:** Selenium WebDriver
* **Browser:** Microsoft Edge (Chromium)

## Key Features
* **Element Location:** Uses `ID` and `CSS Selectors` to robustly identify web elements.
* **Assertions:** Verifies test pass/fail state by checking for specific success strings on the landing page.
* **Error Handling:** Includes try/except blocks to catch execution errors and ensure the browser closes properly.
